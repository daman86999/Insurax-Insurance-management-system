      <ul style="padding: 20px;">
        <li>The sum insured is calculated by multiplying the built up area of your home with the construction rate per sq. feet, e.g. if the built up area of your home is 1000 sq. feet and the construction rate is `800 per sq. feet, the sum insured for your home structure is ` 8 lakhs.</li>
        <li>We recommend the rate of construction for few major cities when you buy online; click here to know the construction cost. However, this value can be revised appropriately if expensive material – like marble flooring – has been used in construction. If your home has lawn / garden surrounded by a perimeter wall, the construction rate can be revised to include the cost of construction of this wall in the home structure sum insured.</li>
        <li>The contents of your home – furniture, durables, clothes, utensils, jewellery, etc., is to be valued on market value basis, that is the current market value of similar items after depreciation.</li>

        <h3>&#10001; &nbsp;How would I benefit by buying health insurance at a young age?</h3>
        <p id="c" style="margin-left: 21px; line-height: 23px;">Buying health insurance at a young age is a prudent decision as it provides several significant benefits like lower premium. Purchasing insurance at 25 years of age benefits the insured with a lower premium amount, as insurers are aware that people are comparatively more fit in their 20s than in their 40s, and are less likely to fall sick due to a strong immune system. The low premium is subject to change however, and is not fixed. It can be changed for various reasons, such as change in age slabs or product and even revision in tax laws. </p>

        <h3>&#10001; &nbsp;What’s the maximum age limit for a complete health insurance plan?</h3>
        <p id="c" style="margin-left: 21px; line-height: 23px;">There is no maximum entry age limit to apply for a complete health insurance plan. However, there are some conditions: </p>
        <ul>
          <li id="c">Applicant should be 18 years of age</li>
          <li id="c">Minimum age for children is 91 days (floater option) and 6 years (individual cover)</li>
          <li id="c">Applicants more than 46 years of age will have to undergo medical tests</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>&#10001; &nbsp;How much health insurance coverage do I need?</h3>

           <h3>&#10001; &nbsp;How would I benefit by buying health insurance at a young age?</h3>
        <p id="c" style="margin-left: 21px; line-height: 23px;">Buying health insurance at a young age is a prudent decision as it provides several significant benefits like lower premium. Purchasing insurance at 25 years of age benefits the insured with a lower premium amount, as insurers are aware that people are comparatively more fit in their 20s than in their 40s, and are less likely to fall sick due to a strong immune system. The low premium is subject to change however, and is not fixed. It can be changed for various reasons, such as change in age slabs or product and even revision in tax laws. </p>
