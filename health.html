        <h3>&#10001; &nbsp;How would I benefit by buying health insurance at a young age?</h3>
        <p id="c" style="margin-left: 21px; line-height: 23px;">Buying health insurance at a young age is a prudent decision as it provides several significant benefits like lower premium. Purchasing insurance at 25 years of age benefits the insured with a lower premium amount, as insurers are aware that people are comparatively more fit in their 20s than in their 40s, and are less likely to fall sick due to a strong immune system. The low premium is subject to change however, and is not fixed. It can be changed for various reasons, such as change in age slabs or product and even revision in tax laws. </p>

        <h3>&#10001; &nbsp;What’s the maximum age limit for a complete health insurance plan?</h3>
        <p id="c" style="margin-left: 21px; line-height: 23px;">There is no maximum entry age limit to apply for a complete health insurance plan. However, there are some conditions: </p>
        <ul>
          <li id="c">Applicant should be 18 years of age</li>
          <li id="c">Minimum age for children is 91 days (floater option) and 6 years (individual cover)</li>
          <li id="c">Applicants more than 46 years of age will have to undergo medical tests</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>&#10001; &nbsp;How much health insurance coverage do I need?</h3>
        <p id="c" style="margin-left: 21px; line-height: 23px;">The amount of coverage needed is based on several deciding factors like current age, health conditions, family medical history, family members and their health conditions, ability to pay premium and hospital preferences

          After considering these factors, an individual decision needs to be made. You can contact us for assistance. </p>
           <h3>&#10001; &nbsp;What is No Claim Bonus (NCB)?</h3>
        <p id="c" style="margin-left: 21px; line-height: 23px;">In case you have made no claim during the policy period, except as an outpatient, the sum insured amount of your policy will increase by a fixed percent – this is called No Claim Bonus. It is transferable and can be carried forward to the next policy tenure.</p>
        <h3>&#10001; &nbsp;What do you mean by pre-existing disease?</h3>
        <p id="c" style="margin-left: 21px; line-height: 23px;">Any condition, aliment or injury or related condition(s), for which you had signs or symptoms and/or were diagnosed and/or received medical advice/treatment within 48/24* months prior to the first policy with the insurance company is called a pre-existing disease. (*as per selected plan)</p>
